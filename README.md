# Weightlifting
Soon there will be a world championship on Weightlifting and all the famous players are preparing for it. As a coach of an international team, your job is to ensure each player has sufficient training, but is not exhausted more than he should. Every day you prepare a list of exercises and at the end of the day you want to know how much the players have trained. The list will be a sequence of N lines holding the exercises of the players in your team for that day.
Write a program that prints all players in alphabetical order. For each player, the program should print the type of exercise and the total weight the player has lifted doing that exercise. The exercises should be ordered alphabetically for each player.
Input
The input comes from the console. The first line holds the length of the input list N. 
On the next N lines, there will be information about the exercises for that day in the following format: “<player> <exercise> <weight> kg”. 
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
Print at the console one line for each player in the following format: <player> : <exercise> - <weight> kg, <exercise> - <weight> kg,…
